                <span class="text-xl font-bold text-black">Global Scope: </span>  If declared outside any function, a var variable becomes a global variable, accessible throughout the entire program.

                <h1 class="mt-8 px-4 text-2xl inter text-justify">REST API, stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural principles and constraints for designing and interacting with web services. It is an architectural style for building networked applications and is commonly used in the context of the World Wide Web. </h1>
                <p class="mt-5 px-8 text-xl">
                  <span class="text-xl font-bold text-black">Statelessness: </span> Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. The server should not store any client state between requests. This makes REST APIs scalable and easy to maintain.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-5 px-8 text-xl">
                  <span class="text-xl font-bold text-black">Client-Server Architecture: </span> REST separates the client (the user interface or application) from the server (the data storage or processing). This separation allows for more flexibility and scalability in the architecture.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-5 px-8 text-xl">
                  <span class="text-xl font-bold text-black">Uniform Interface: </span>REST APIs have a consistent and uniform interface, which simplifies interactions between clients and servers. This interface is typically based on standard HTTP methods like GET (for reading data), POST (for creating data), PUT (for updating data), and DELETE (for removing data).
                </p>
                <p class="mt-5 px-8 text-xl">
                  <span class="text-xl font-bold text-black">Resource-Based: </span>REST APIs are based on resources, which can be any data entity, such as objects, documents, or services. Each resource is identified by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
                </p>
                <p class="mt-5 px-8 text-xl">
                  <span class="text-xl font-bold text-black">Representation: </span>Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML, which clients can use to interact with the resource. Clients can choose the representation format that best suits their needs.
                </p>
                <h1 class="mt-8 px-4 text-2xl inter text-justify">RESTful APIs have become the standard for building web services due to their simplicity, scalability, and ease of use. They are widely used in various web and mobile applications to exchange data and perform operations over the internet.
